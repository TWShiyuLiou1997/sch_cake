## 🕊️ In Loving Memory of Dave Täht

### **🇹🇼：他的心願，我來實現 (Tā de xīn yuàn, wǒ lái shí xiàn)**
### **🇺🇸：His wish, I finished.**
*(A Linux Pun: In our world, a wish ending in **.sh** is a command to be executed!)*

---

### **"穿越時空的夢想，我來幫他實現！"**
**(Making a time-traveling dream come true!)**

### 🎇 The Spirit of the Code: "Fireworks in the Dark"

**"一支穿雲箭，千軍萬馬來相見"**
*(One arrow pierces the clouds, and ten thousand troops come to meet.)*

This Chinese idiom describes a signal so powerful it rallies everyone.
**Dave was that arrow.**
Just like fireworks are most mesmerizing in the darkest night, Dave shone brightest when fighting the invisible enemy of Bufferbloat.

* **"The darker the night, the brighter the light."**
* He worked tirelessly in the dead of night (just as we often do) to **tame the network chaos.**
* Now, "Ten Thousand" (萬) legacy devices are rallying to his call.

### 🏹 The "Archer" Coincidence: A Destiny Revealed

While digging through Dave's old blog posts and presentations, I found a chilling coincidence that proves this project was meant to be.

**1. The "Archer" & The Arrow**
The router series I ported this to is named **"Archer"** (TP-Link). An Archer shoots an **Arrow**.
This perfectly matches our tribute slogan: **"一支穿雲箭 (One Cloud-Piercing Arrow)"**.

**2. The C7 Origin**
In the original 2015 "Cake" presentation at Battlemesh v8, Dave and Jonathan Morton used a **TP-Link Archer C7** to demonstrate that CAKE could shape traffic at 115Mbps while HTB failed.
> *"HTB can’t shape at 115Mbps. Cake can."* — *Battlemesh v8 (2015)*

**3. The C2 Connection**
In his 2016 blog post *"Finally... the real net-next 4.8 fq_codel results"*, Dave wrote:
> *"I pulled the **odroid C2** out, and made it the test driver..."*
Today, we have successfully ported his work to the **TP-Link Archer C2**.

**Dave was the Archer.**
**The Code is the Arrow.**
**And we are the target: A bufferbloat-free world.**

We are fulfilling a specific wish he made 5 years ago on Reddit:

### ❝ Help port the code to more chipsets. ❞

> **The BEST engineering result I ever had:**
> Essentially the summation of my 16+ years of work to that point on making wifi better. Unpatented. Please share and enjoy.
> **Help port the code to more chipsets.**

## 📂 Repository Contents (Padavan Port)

This fork contains specific backports of CAKE for **MediaTek (MTK)** based routers running older Linux kernels (Padavan Firmware).

| Directory | Kernel Version | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/Padavan 3.4.113`** | **Linux 3.4.x** | **Legacy Backport.** Highly optimized for MT7620/MT7621 devices running the classic Padavan 3.4 kernel. Allows older hardware to run CAKE! |
| **`/Padavan 4.4.198`** | **Linux 4.4.x** | **Modern Backport.** For newer MT7621/MT7615 devices running the Padavan 4.4 kernel (hanwckf/padavan-4.4). |
| **`/` (Root)** | **Upstream** | The original upstream source code from `dtaht/sch_cake`. |

### Usage
If you are building Padavan firmware, simply replace the `sch_cake` directory in your kernel source (usually under `linux/net/sched/`) with the contents of the folder matching your kernel version.

## 🌟 Project Philosophy: Open & Accessible

### **「永遠保持開放且開源的精神」**
**(Forever maintaining an open and open-source spirit)**

Dave turned down numerous lucrative contracts to keep his code **Free and Open Source**. He valued global impact over prestige. Because of him, millions of devices—from Starlink satellites to rural ISP routers—deliver smoother connectivity.

This repo exists to keep that spirit alive by ensuring the code remains accessible for "Do-It-Yourself" router enthusiasts and custom firmware builders.

## ℹ️ About CAKE (Original README)

*The following is the original project description:*

### Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE) scheduler

This is the out-of-tree version of **[CAKE](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/)**, the Linux qdisc that combines scheduler and traffic shaper for effective bufferbloat mitigation.

**Note:** `sch_cake` is part of the upstream Linux kernel since **kernel version 4.19**, so this repository exists primarily as a resource for building the qdisc with older versions of the kernel (like 3.4 and 4.4 provided in this fork).

If you're already on kernel 4.19 or newer, you can just load CAKE with `tc` and the kernel shipped by your distribution!

This is the out-of-tree version of [[https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/][CAKE]], the Linux qdisc that combines scheduler

Note that sch_cake is part of the upstream Linux kernel since kernel version
