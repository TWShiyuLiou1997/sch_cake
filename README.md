## 🕊️ In Loving Memory of Dave Täht

### **🇹🇼：他的心願，我來實現 (Tā de xīn yuàn, wǒ lái shí xiàn)**
### **🇺🇸：His wish, I finished.**
*(A Linux Pun: In our world, a wish ending in **.sh** is a command to be executed!)*

---

### **"穿越時空的夢想，我來幫他實現！"**
**(Making a time-traveling dream come true!)**

### 🎇 The Spirit of the Code: "Fireworks in the Dark"

**"一支穿雲箭，千軍萬馬來相見"**
*(One arrow pierces the clouds, and ten thousand troops come to meet.)*

This Chinese idiom describes a signal so powerful it rallies everyone.
**Dave was that arrow.**
Just like fireworks are most mesmerizing in the darkest night, Dave shone brightest when fighting the invisible enemy of Bufferbloat.

* **"The darker the night, the brighter the light."**
* He worked tirelessly in the dead of night (just as we often do) to **tame the network chaos.**
* Now, "Ten Thousand" (萬) legacy devices are rallying to his call.

### 🏹 The "Archer" Coincidence: A Destiny Revealed

While digging through Dave's old blog posts and presentations, I found a chilling coincidence that proves this project was meant to be.

**1. The "Archer" & The Arrow**
The router series I ported this to is named **"Archer"** (TP-Link). An Archer shoots an **Arrow**.
This perfectly matches our tribute slogan: **"一支穿雲箭 (One Cloud-Piercing Arrow)"**.

**2. The C7 Origin**
In the original 2015 "Cake" presentation at Battlemesh v8, Dave and Jonathan Morton used a **TP-Link Archer C7** to demonstrate that CAKE could shape traffic at 115Mbps while HTB failed.
> *"HTB can’t shape at 115Mbps. Cake can."* — *Battlemesh v8 (2015)*

**3. The C2 Connection**
In his 2016 blog post *"Finally... the real net-next 4.8 fq_codel results"*, Dave wrote:
> *"I pulled the **odroid C2** out, and made it the test driver..."*
Today, we have successfully ported his work to the **TP-Link Archer C2**.

**Dave was the Archer.**
**The Code is the Arrow.**
**And we are the target: A bufferbloat-free world.**

### 🧩 The "Missing Piece": The MT76 Prophecy

In his famous 2016 blog post *["Hardware from hell"](http://the-edge.taht.net/post/hardware_from_hell/)*, Dave expressed his frustration with locked hardware. But amidst the chaos, he had his eyes on a specific target—the **MediaTek (mt76)** platform.

> "I tried to get a **mt76 box** from alibaba - sold out - **this is the new hotness** in the OpenWrt 802.11ac world... A turris omnia will probably become my next eval platform **unless I can get a mt76 up and running**."
> — Dave Täht (2016)

**The Tragedy:** He couldn't get one. It was sold out. He was forced to struggle with older devices.
**The Fulfillment:** This repository is dedicated entirely to **MT7620/MT7621** devices.

**We finally got that "mt76 box" up and running for you, Dave.**
The "new hotness" you foresaw is now the stable foundation carrying your legacy.

**🇹🇼：遲來的約定**
當他在 2016 年苦尋不到一台 MT76 路由器時，也許沒想到，幾年後會有成千上萬台 MT76 設備，運行著他的 CAKE 演算法，在網路上奔馳。
**Dave，這台 MT76，我們幫你跑起來了！**

### ⭐ Light up the Dark: A Final Tribute

**"The darker the night, the brighter the light."**

Did you know? Dave's surname **"Täht"** literally means **"Star"** in Estonian.

If this project helps you, or if you simply want to honor his legacy, please **Light up the "Star"** in the top-right corner of this repository.

Let's keep his Star shining bright in the open-source world, guiding packets through the dark.

We are fulfilling a specific wish he made 5 years ago on Reddit:

### ❝ Help port the code to more chipsets. ❞

> **The BEST engineering result I ever had:**
> Essentially the summation of my 16+ years of work to that point on making wifi better. Unpatented. Please share and enjoy.
> **Help port the code to more chipsets.**
>
> — *Dave Täht (Reddit, 5 years ago)*

*Original Source:* [Reddit - r/Starlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/okmx3x/comment/h61unnn/)

Dave turned down numerous lucrative contracts to keep his code **Free and Open Source**. He valued global impact over prestige. Because of him, millions of devices—from Starlink satellites to rural ISP routers—deliver smoother connectivity.

### **🇹🇼：靈魂永駐，精神長存**
### **🇺🇸：May his soul find eternal peace, and his spirit live on forever in our routers.**

## 📂 Repository Contents (Padavan Port)

This fork contains specific backports of CAKE for **MediaTek (MTK)** based routers running older Linux kernels (Padavan Firmware).

| Directory | Kernel Version | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/Padavan 3.4.113`** | **Linux 3.4.x** | **Legacy Backport.** Highly optimized for MT7620/MT7621 devices running the classic Padavan 3.4 kernel. Allows older hardware to run CAKE! |
| **`/Padavan 4.4.198`** | **Linux 4.4.x** | **Modern Backport.** For newer MT7621/MT7615 devices running the Padavan 4.4 kernel (hanwckf/padavan-4.4). |
| **`/` (Root)** | **Upstream** | The original upstream source code from `dtaht/sch_cake`. |

### Usage
If you are building Padavan firmware, simply replace the `sch_cake` directory in your kernel source (usually under `linux/net/sched/`) with the contents of the folder matching your kernel version.

## ℹ️ About CAKE (Original README)

### Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE) scheduler

This is the out-of-tree version of **[CAKE](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/)**, the Linux qdisc that combines scheduler and traffic shaper for effective bufferbloat mitigation.

**Note:** `sch_cake` is part of the upstream Linux kernel since **kernel version 4.19**. This repository exists primarily as a resource for building the qdisc with older versions of the kernel (like 3.4 and 4.4).
